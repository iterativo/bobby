## Synopsis

Bash script to check if a URL has certain text in it. This can be useful when youâ€™re waiting for text status change to happen on a website. For example, waiting to see when a product becomes available online. 

## Motivation

I wrote this after finding myself periodically checking a particular product to become available on a popular e-commerce site. With the help of this script, now I could just let it run in the background for me (via a [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) job)
